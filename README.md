# 32-bit Multiplier using Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)

This repository contains the Verilog code for a 32-bit multiplier implemented using a Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA).

## Features

- **32-bit Multiplier**: Efficiently multiplies two 32-bit numbers.
- **Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)**: Enhances speed by reducing the carry propagation delay.

## Architecture

The multiplier uses the CLA to add partial products, optimizing the overall speed of the multiplication operation.

## Installation

To use the code, clone this repository and include the Verilog files in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohitshekdar/32bit_multiplier_CLA.git
